                    <p>On March 21, 2012 at approximately 2:16 AM, Officer McGrath of the Fairfield Police Department was on patrol in the area of Sasco Hill Road when he came into contact with an autistic teenage male running in the middle of the road.  The male was not wearing any shoes or socks and was soaking wet. It was immediately recognized by Officer McGrath that the male was not able to communicate; could not speak and could not write.  Fairfield Police Officers then spent several hours attempting to identify the male but with no success.  In order to ensure the male's safety, he was transported to Saint Vincent's Medical Center.  Police were faced with no other option than to await the frantic early morning 911 call when the male's mother woke up and found her son missing.</p>

                    <p>As a result of this incident, Officer Stahl, who had assisted Officer McGrath, came to a realization that there was a very emergent need to develop a program to assist Police in safely returning to their homes, members of our community who are prone to wandering.  Officer Stahl envisioned a computer driven program wherein members of the community would be able to register their family members or friends who suffer from mental disorders/illnesses that make them susceptible to "wandering" (i.e. Dementia, Alzheimer's, Autism, Down Syndrome, Bi-Polar Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc.).  Once registered, Officers would have the ability to search the program using a variety of variables such as, name, physical characteristics, age, and more.  In addition, each registrant would have at least two photographs on file, one front profile and one side profile.  In the event an Officer encounters someone who is unable to communicate, he/she would have the ability to enter the program and open a gallery of photographs, enabling them to match the photograph with the person standing in front of them, click on the picture, and the person's information and emergency contact would appear.  All of this would be accessible/viewable from the in car laptops or any desktop within Police Headquarters.</p>

                    <p>In order to make this concept a reality, Officer Stahl, a Fairfield University graduate, sought the assistance of Cath Borgman, Director of Career Planning at Fairfield University, who in turn put him in contact with Dr. Wook-Sung Yoo, Professor of Software Engineering at Fairfield University.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Yoo, having extensive experience in Healthcare Software, was immediately intrigued by the concept of this program and was very enthusiastic to bring the concept to his students.  Graduate students, Ebenezer Rodriguez Vidal and Michael Marrero, selected to take on the endeavor of creating the SafeReturn Network as part of their capstone project.  The Safe Return Network was completed in May 2013 and is beginning to benefit the Fairfield Community!</p>
